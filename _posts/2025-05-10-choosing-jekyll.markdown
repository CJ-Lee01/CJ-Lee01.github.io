Given that I have failed to secure a summer internship this summer, I decided to go on my own path to improve myself by building some projects that I thought of building but did not have the time during school to do so, along with a goal for losing weight.

The first step to showcase the projects I have is to have a portfolio site where I can explain the motivations that drove me to create the projects. At the same time, I was slightly interested in technical writing - I occassionally catch up with tech blogs from both companies and individuals. 

This means that my site should serve 2 main purposes: host information about the stuff I worked on, and host the content for my blogs. At the same time, I love to share stuff that I found interesting, so it also should have a section for that.

I ultimately went with Jekyll due to its native support for RSS. Despite [RSS being an old format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), it is still reliable as the "protocol" for getting blog posts, given how simple it is. I use RSS to get blog posts from other websites, and it is pleasantly easy to set up the RSS feed using their RSS urls.

Jeykll also allows me to write blog posts in Markdown, which is highly appreciated since I don't really like to write posts in a markup language.
