I am quite late to the trend of asking if 100 men can take on gorillas. So far many of the takes I seen revolve around many burly men taking on a gorilla, but I would like to give another perspective on how 100 men can take on a gorilla.

## Apes Together Strong

An iconic quote from the [War for the Planet of the Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1THE-vyhk4A). The essence of this quote is that despite the weaknesses of individuals, there is solidarity in a group that can overcome adversity. 

Similarly, humans have never always hunted alone - they may hunt in groups for larger animals. Even without the modern technology that we have today, humans have successfully hunted large animals in the past. See the wooly mammoth - [there](https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/08/21/to-kill-mammoths-in-the-ice-age-people-used-planted-pikes-not-throwing-spears-researchers-say/) [are](https://sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2023/06/hunting_mammoth.php) [strong](https://thedebrief.org/14000-years-ago-ancient-humans-tracked-hunted-and-killed-this-massive-land-animal/) [archaeological](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/article299773989.html) [evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/science/mexico-mammoth-traps.html) that humans hunted mammoths with simple and primitive weapons. What is stopping 100 of us from replicating that, except instead of a mammoth, its a gorilla?

## The method
Suppose these 100 men will face the gorilla on a flat land. 

Firstly, they will dig a huge hole that is big enough to trap a gorilla. Then, the unlucky ones will lure the gorilla to the trap. The rest will push the gorilla in and injure the gorilla with sticks and stones.

This will require some sacrifices in order to keep the gorilla occupied while digging the hole and to lure the gorilla to the hole. However, as a wise man said,

### What if you can't dig
Suppose you can't dig and can't aquire any other resources to fight against the gorilla.

Then there is another attribute of humans that give them an edge over the gorilla: Endurance.

Humans evolved to outlast rather than outfight prey or enemies. This was their way of hunting until rifles made it unncessarily. [They even can outrun horses over long distances](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23231031-300-humans-are-better-endurance-runners-than-any-other-animal/). In this case, we can (hopefully) outrun the gorilla, and then come back and defeat it when it becomes tired from all the running. Human prevails.

### Edge cases
100 babies, 100 physically disabled men, 100 cannibals (maybe they would eat each other?). I don't know how this would turn out, and I do not wish to imagine it.
