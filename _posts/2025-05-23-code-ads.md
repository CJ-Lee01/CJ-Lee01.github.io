Recently I was reading up on Kotlin Coroutine Continuation as I was looking into solving a bug that hit maximum recursion depth and was hoping that it would resolve the issue with continuation passing style.

As I was reading, I encountered a portion that didn't make sense:

| :-: |
| It was 2am when I was reading it |

Confused, I went to reread the previous section several times and decided to take a short break. When I came back, I noticed the ad buttons on the top right and realised what it was.

Remember that taking a break can give you a mental reset to have a fresh look at the problem again.
