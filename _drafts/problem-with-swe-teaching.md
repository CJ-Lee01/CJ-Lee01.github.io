So far, I have taken 3 software engineering courses. The latest one I took was called _Foundation of Software Engineering_. When I took it, I initially expected to learn the principles behind the various practices in software engineering. Afterall, [best practices change](https://youtu.be/x7cQ3mrcKaY), but principles remain firm against the test of time.

However, the course did not seem to know what it was about.
