In some courses, they require students to come up with a project and do the things related to their course in the project. For example, in a course that teaches about the fundamentals of machine learning, the course lecturer may, with good intentions, want students to solve relevant problems with machine learning methods.

What frustrates me is when these lecturers grade the projects not only based on its application of the knowledge of the course, but also based on how valuable the problem to be solved is. As much as people like to complain about things, selecting a problem to focus on and tackle is very difficult. The only time this would be acceptable was if the skill of problem identification is also taught as part of the course.

## The value of solving problems is uncertain until enough time has passed.
Let's take for example: React.

React is one of the most popular JS frameworks today, but its start was not smooth. If you read this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1fak87/react_facebooks_latest_javascript_client_library/), you will see that there were many people who were skeptical of React:

Yet, a year later, it is easy to say that React [had some successes](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2014/05/29/one-year-of-open-source-react.html), and a decade later, it definitely became widely successful. It is very easy to have hindsight and see the problem that was being solved and the value in solving it, but having the foresight is much more difficult.

## The Luck Component in assessments
Selecting a good problem to solve then becomes like a trying to shoot a target blindfolded. The only difference is that you can shoot again quickly after realizing that you have missed, but you won't know you have selected a bad problem until much later when there is sunk cost.

As much as it is impossible to get rid of all the luck in assessments (e.g. Student having illnesses, Student feeling super great that day), it would be a fair and objective assessment if instructors were to remove as much element of luck that is in their control as possible.

## The Alternative
Still, project-based assessments are important. It allows the group to collaborate and come up with different ideas to solve a problem. 

Maybe reward the students for following a disciplined problem solving process.
